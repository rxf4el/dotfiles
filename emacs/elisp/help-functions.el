  "Insert CHAR followed by a space using a key event so modes can respond appropriately.

I use this to automatically insert a space after punctuation characters. It
might sound like a micro-optimization but I think of it more like making the
keyboard work like it ought to work ;).

When I first tried to set this up I bound the .-key to a function that inserted
itself and then a space like this `(insert \". \")'. This inserts what you
want but doesn't generate a key event for other modes to handle. For example
`auto-fill-mode' won't break the line because it doesn't know that anything
happened. When you do hit another key `auto-fill-mode' kicks in and breaks the
line—I found that disturbing to my flow so I set this up instead.

Does the \"right thing\" under `org-mode'."
